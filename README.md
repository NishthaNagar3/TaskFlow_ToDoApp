# TaskFlow_ToDoApp
Task Flow ToDoApp Project 
TaskFlow is a responsive, dynamic, and elegant To-Do application built using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. It helps users manage their productivity across multiple task stages: 
Todo, Completed, and Archived â€” all while demonstrating clean code, smooth UX, and smart local storage handling.

## Project Objectives
By building TaskFlow, I aimed to:

1. Build fully responsive web interfaces with HTML/CSS
2. Add dynamic, interactive features using Vanilla JavaScript
3. Use localStorage for data persistence
4. Integrate with external APIs for user avatars and dummy tasks
5.Ensure form validation, state management, and clean UI transitions
