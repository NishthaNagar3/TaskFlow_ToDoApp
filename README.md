# TaskFlow_ToDoApp
Task Flow ToDoApp Project 
TaskFlow is a responsive, dynamic, and elegant To-Do application built using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. It helps users manage their productivity across multiple task stages: 
Todo, Completed, and Archived â€” all while demonstrating clean code, smooth UX, and smart local storage handling.

## Project Objectives
By building TaskFlow, I aimed to:

->Build fully responsive web interfaces with HTML/CSS
-> Add dynamic, interactive features using Vanilla JavaScript
-> Use localStorage for data persistence
-> Integrate with external APIs for user avatars and dummy tasks
-> Ensure form validation, state management, and clean UI transitions
