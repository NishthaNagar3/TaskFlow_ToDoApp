# TaskFlow_ToDoApp
Task Flow ToDoApp Project 
TaskFlow is a responsive, dynamic, and elegant To-Do application built using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript. It helps users manage their productivity across multiple task stages: 
Todo, Completed, and Archived — all while demonstrating clean code, smooth UX, and smart local storage handling.

## Project Objectives
By building TaskFlow, I aimed to:
1. Build fully responsive web interfaces with HTML/CSS
2. Add dynamic, interactive features using Vanilla JavaScript
3. Use localStorage for data persistence
4. Integrate with external APIs for user avatars and dummy tasks
5. Ensure form validation, state management, and clean UI transitions

## Tech Stack:
1. HTML5
2. CSS3 (Custom CSS, no frameworks)
3. Vanilla JavaScript
4. localStorage
5. External APIs:
   1. UI Avatars API
   2. DummyJSON Todos API


## Application Structure
1️. Landing Page – index.html
   1. Age Verification (must be >10 years old)
   2. User input form (name & DOB)
   3. Form validation + data persistence via localStorage
   4. Auto-redirect if user already exists

2. Main Application – app.html
   1. Displays user's name + avatar
   2. Task management across:
   3. Todo
   4. Completed
   5. Archived
   6. Add new tasks
   7. Move tasks across stages
   8. Track last modified timestamp
   9. Sign out functionality (clears localStorage)


## Core Features
1. Landing Page
   1. Age verification using DOB (must be over 10)
   2. Form validations
   3. Store user data in localStorage
   4. Auto-redirect on returning visit
   
2. Task Management
   1. Dynamic profile with avatar (UI Avatars API)
   2. Add new tasks
   3. Move tasks between Todo ↔ Completed ↔ Archived
   4. Show last modified timestamp
   5. Task counters by stage
   6. Fetch dummy todos (DummyJSON API) on first visit
   7. Persistent state across reloads

## Creative Contributions
I have designed and developed all UI components, page layouts, logos, color palettes, and responsive interactions. No UI frameworks or pre-built design systems were used.
UI Highlights: 
I. Clean, modern, and minimal design
II. Mobile-first responsive layout
III. Smooth transitions between task stages
IV. Color-coded stage distinctions
V. Creative improvements over reference design
